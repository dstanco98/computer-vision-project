## Semi-automatic offside detection for Football

## Abstract

Here, I present my attempt toward the creation of a mechanism by which the problem of incorrect offside decisions made by referees in football can be addressed. The purpose of this system is to replicate the operation of the semi-automatic offside introduced in the last edition of the <b>Fifa World Cup in Qatar</b> but with some assumptions and restrictions. The offside detection problem is simplified by classifying the attacking and defending team based on the half in which the foward ball is played. Further the assumption that team members wear the same coloured jerseys works towards simplifying the problem.
The implementation involves two separate modules that track the ball and players respectively. The successful integration of the modules leads to the desired goal of offside detection.
